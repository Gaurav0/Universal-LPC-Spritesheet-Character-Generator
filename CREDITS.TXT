In plain English:  This credits file is automatically generated to the best of our ability, but it remains YOUR RESPONSIBILITY as a game developer to ensure that the art you use is attributed properly.  That is, we can't be held liable even if all of the information in this file is completely wrong.   In addition, some of the art listed in this file may have SPECIAL ATTRIBUTION INSTRUCTIONS that ask that you credit the artist in a particular way, rather than a verbatim copyright notice.  In those cases, you will probably need to hand-edit this file to comply with their instructions.  In some older art, attribution instructions may be included in the art description itself.  Please check the art page to be sure.

We recommend that you delete this notice when you're sure the information here is correct and the attribution instructions are properly followed.  If you aren't the game developer and you're seeing this notice here in the credits, it probably means that the developer hasn't properly verified the attribution information contained herein even though it said they were supposed to do it right on the page where they downloaded this file.

I added a missing pixel to left and right walk frames, but the only other modification I did was cutout. I don&#039;t need attribution for art, just credit bluecarrot16. I ask that you credit me if you use the algorithm but I don&#039;t know how that applies to licensing so it&#039;s not mandatory.

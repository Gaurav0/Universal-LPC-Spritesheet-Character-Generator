Universal LPC Spritesheet Character Generator
=============================================

Based on [Universal LPC Spritesheet](https://github.com/jrconway3/Universal-LPC-spritesheet).

Try it out at [gaurav.munjal.us](http://gaurav.munjal.us/Universal-LPC-Spritesheet-Character-Generator).

The project you are looking now is an expansion on the above mentioned projects. I try to include all LPC created art up to now.

### Run

To run this project, just clone the repo and open ``index.html`` in your browser of choice.

### Caution

This is not an example of a nicely coded project, and it does have bugs.
In my current project I am using to create a vast amount of awesome different characters, and the results are beautiful.

Still, feel free to enhance the code where you like, but for now, I focus on just adding content.

### Status

Support still working on:

- [Teens](https://opengameart.org/content/lpc-teen-unisex-base-clothes)
- [Pregnant women](https://opengameart.org/content/lpc-pregnancy-bases-maternity-wear)
- [Extra shields](https://opengameart.org/content/lpc-shields-pack)
- [Triumph](https://opengameart.org/content/lpc-major-triumph)
